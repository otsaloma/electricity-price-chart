Finnish Electricity Price Chart
===============================

A visualization of Finnish electricity spot prices in two parts: (1) A
lambda function that downloads data from the [ENTSO-E API][] using
[entsoe-py][] to an S3 bucket and (2) a static client-side web app that
renders that data into a custom visualization.

[ENTSO-E API]: https://transparency.entsoe.eu/content/static_content/Static%20content/web%20api/Guide.html

## Getting Started

Create a `.env` file with the following content.

```bash
ENTSOE_API_KEY=...
```

Create a virtual environment and run `./download.py local` to fetch
price data, then use `make run` to launch the web app locally.
